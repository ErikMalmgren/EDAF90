**Reflection question 1: How do you replace the application icon, favicon.ico?**

* Upload another icon with same name, or change path 

**Reflection Question 2: If you use nav-pills instead of nav-tabs the selected page is no longer highlighted in the menu, why? Hint: <NavLink> and the active css class.**

* The pills do not use the .active css selector, while the tabs do

**Reflection Question 3: What is the meaning of a leading / in a path, the difference between <Link to="/view-ingredient/:name" /> and <Link to="view-ingredient/:name" />?**

* using / uses the absolute path from root directory, while not using it uses the relative path from the current directory *
